# sfml-colorselector
Simple mouse-based color selection tool for SFML. The selection box is 256x256 pixels, with a 16x256 pixel hue slider 8 pixels to the right of the box.

Written in Code::Blocks, using GCC 5.1.0 and SFML 2.4.2  
(I see no reason why it shouldn't work with 2.5.1, and tested that briefly without incident)
